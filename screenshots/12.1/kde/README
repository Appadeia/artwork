Hello! 

This is brief description of each screenshot. The list is loosely sorted by importance:


* Activity-manager:
The activity manager widget in the panel lets you switch between Plasma activities as well as create, delete, stop and start activities etc.

* Samba:
You can now share folders via samba by right clicking folders in Dolphin (prerequisite: samba is installed and running, and configured to allow users to share folders, all this can easily be done in the YaST samba server module)

* Clementine
The Clementine music player is now included in the official distribution. It's a "clone" of old Amarok 1.4.

* Akonadi-googledata
The new Akonadi-based KDEPIM (Kontact, KMail, KOrganizer etc.) in KDE SC 4.7 is still rather immature, but it already has some nice new features such as support for Google Calendar and Google Contacts (package: akonadi-googledata)

* digiKam
digiKam 2.2 has exciting new features such as face detection and recognition and creating panoramas.

* Marble
Marble has routing with Open Street Map and support for voice navigation.

* Synaptiks 
openSUSE 12.1 sports the latest version (0.7) of the synaptiks  touchpad management tool.

* Plasmoid-networkmanagement
The NetworkManager plasmoid is much better than it used to be and supports NetworkManager 0.9

* Bluedevil
The bluedevil bluetooth tool is much improved.

* Desktop
A screenshot of the full desktop (as I *think* it'll look like in 12.1 final)
