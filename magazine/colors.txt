The file `opensusemagazine.gpl' contains a GIMP palette with the colors used.
(For use with inkscape, copy to /usr/share/inkscape/palettes/ .)

The lightest green is almost always used with a 60% opacity on a white
background.

I did not use the complement colors in the design, but they may be useful for
some typography.
