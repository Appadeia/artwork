the scribus file is there to be used as an example. I'm not an artist and don't have the time now to fine tune a flyer file.

But I want to show that we have to make a file fitted to the personal printer use, to be printed not by a professional (that is mass printed then cut to the right size), but by anybody with a laser or inkjet printer, so tied with margins of the paper color.

That way one have to cope with pretty large margin (specially at the bottom of the page) and can't afford to print color background - much too ink expensive.

In this situation, one can use blank paper (that said, remember than in some countries like France, and for poster to be shown in public places, blank paper in for government use only), or color paper.

As it's not possible to print with white ink, color paper for openSUSE can only be light green (if green), and it's very difficult to know what is the result of color print to color paper, most usual inks being transparent.
