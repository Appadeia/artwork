Welcome to openSUSE

Hello! We’re the international openSUSE 
Community team—friendly, welcoming and active
in creating the premier Linux for the future

What We Do

We provide an open and innovative atmosphere. 
Here, barriers and limitations don’t exist. We 
believe in the freedom to create technology that 
will better ourselves and the world. It’s why 
everything we do is free and open.


Working Together

Our freedom-loving philosophy is what drives us 
and is why we work extensively with the wider 
Free Software community and other Linux 
distributions. We also initiate new projects and 
embrace anyone who wants to build upon our 
technology or integrate it into their own project. 
One example is Appstream, which helps unify 
software installation. Our package building 
infrastructure delivers more than 120,000 
packages to 30,000 users supporting 21 distros 
on seven architectures.

Helping You Out

Whether you’re a new user looking for help, or 
an experienced developer looking to cross-
compile and distribute software, openSUSE 
provides the tools and support you need.
